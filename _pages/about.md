My name is Karol (Carlito) and I work in a technology department supporting digital marketing teams in Europe and Africa. Around 2018 *I was picked by the email marketing profession* to build and automate emails using Salesforce Marketing Cloud platform. I'd like to keep working with **Salesforce** and its **Trailblazers Community** forever and ever.

## Purpose

I can't memorize it all, therefore I take notes. The posts on this blog are my notes written in a plain, simplified English similar to the language found in technical documentation. I document anything that's useful at work that is: **HTML email hacks, MSExcel formulas, SQL queries, JavaScript snippets**  plus some loose ideas about the web and career. All the practical examples have been tested and used by myself with a satisfactory result. After a while some of these notes may need a revision which I don't guarantee.

## Copyrights

The source code for this website has been forked from a 'ridiculously elegant Jekyll theme' called Reverie. You can find and praise the project on [Amit Merchant's Github repo](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie).
I attribute each post with resources that I used to solve a case and to document the solution as a note in this weblog.
I share notes and you can use content from this weblog without restrictions apart from those inherited from other resources that I used for personal use.
