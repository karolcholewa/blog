My name is Karol Cholewa (Carlito) and this is my **technical-marketer's blog**. Around 2018 I was picked by the email marketing profession to build and automate emails using Salesforce Marketing Cloud platform and my modest web development skills. I'd like to keep doing it for another decade or longer. 

### Purpose

Posts on this blog are practical notes written in a plain, simplified English similar to the language found in technical documentation. I document anything that's useful for me at work that is: **HTML email hacks, MS Excel formulas, SQL queries, JavaScript snippets**, and ideas. Practical examples have been tested and used by myself with a satisfactory result. After a while some of these notes may need a revision which I don't guarantee.

### Copyrights
