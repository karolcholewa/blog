Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Karol (Carlito) and this is my **tech marketer's weblog** where I put down short notes, recipies, and snippets worth reusing without remembering each by heart. I work in a technology team supporting internal business partners that is: Digital Marketing Teams, Creative and Communications Teams, and Customer Service Teams in the Europe and Africa region. Around 2018 *I was picked by the email marketing profession* to build and automate emails using. This is how I became a [Trailblazer](https://trailblazer.me/id/kcholewa) and a passionate power user of **Salesforce Marketing Cloud**.


## â˜… Purpose 

I write posts in a plain, simplified English similar to the language found in technical documentation. I save useful **HTML email hacks, MSExcel formulas, SQL queries, JavaScript snippets**  plus loose ideas about the web and career that I find interesting or even inspiring. Snippets and recipies were tested and successfully used near post publishing dates. As the time passes tools and applications do change, therefore some of these notes may need a revision which I don't guarantee.
