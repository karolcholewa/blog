Hi!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Karol (Carlito) and this is my **martech weblog**. Here I put down short notes, recipies, and code snippets that I found useful or interesting or both. Around 2018 *I was picked by the email marketing profession* to build and automate emails. This is how I started blazing the trail of the **Salesforce Marketing Cloud**.


## â˜… Purpose 

I can't memorize everything so I have to put down the notes. I document useful **HTML email hacks, MSExcel formulas, platform hints, SQL queries, JavaScript snippets** and references to web resources. Code snippets have been tested and usually used at least once by myself. Some of the notes may become outdated or even obsolete and I don't guarantee revisions.
