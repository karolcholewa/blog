Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Karol (Carlito) and this is my weblog where I put down anything worth reusing but not necessarily remembering by heart. I work in a technology team supporting internal business partners that is: Digital Marketing Teams, Creative and Communications Teams, and Customer Service Teams in the Europe and Africa region. Around 2018 *I was picked by the email marketing profession* to build and automate emails using Salesforce Marketing Cloud platform. This is how I became a [Trailblazer](https://trailblazer.me/id/kcholewa), proficient in email marketing and **Salesforce Marketing Cloud**.


## Purpose

The posts on this blog are my notes written in a plain, simplified English similar to the language found in technical documentation. I document **HTML email hacks, MSExcel formulas, SQL queries, JavaScript snippets**  plus some loose ideas about the web and career. Posts have a publishing date and snippets or recipies presented within were successfuly used near those dates. As the time passes tools and applications do change therefore some of these notes may need a revision which I don't guarantee.

## Copyrights

The source code for this website has been forked from a 'ridiculously elegant Jekyll theme' called Reverie. You can find and praise the project on [Amit Merchant's Github repo](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie).
I attribute each post with resources that I used to solve a case and to document the solution as a note in this weblog.
I share notes and you can use content from this weblog without restrictions apart from those inherited from other resources that I used for personal use.
