This is a charity project to help raise funds for [Herbalife Nutrition Foundation](https://www.herbalifenutritionfoundation.org/), which helps providing access to healthy nutrition to children around the world. All money collected will improve children’s lives, and participants will take a hand-made, natural and environmental-friendly bar of soap home with them.

Some technical details about this year’s Mark Hughes Project:



*   Purchased a new domain for this: [https://www.mhday2019.pl](https://www.mhday2019.pl)
*   The old project from last year was moved to the [https://www.mhday2018.pl](https://www.mhday2018.pl) domain
*   Both domains and the web server is hosted by smarthost.pl (my personal account)
*   SSL certificates are automatically issued for each domain registered with Smarthost
*   Added the `.htaccess `file to the main` public_html` folder to force redirection from http to https
*   The project is based on [Foundation Zurb 6](https://foundation.zurb.com/) (the 2018 edition was made using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/))
*   The registration form to collect email addresses uses Google Forms
*   Email addresses from the form are saved to Google Spreadsheet
