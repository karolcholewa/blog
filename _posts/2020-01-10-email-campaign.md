Predictability stems from consistency. The better you plan your email marketing campaign the easier to react to the unexpected. Here is a list of no-brainers and some quite insightful findings:



1. Do you have an email template or need to build one? The template must be mobile responsive - do you need additional help with coding?
2. Do you have branding guidelines in place? Are changes to the template likely to occur frequently? 
3. Do you plan some “enhancements” such as background images, custom fonts, conditional formatting, interactive features, performance heavy elements?
4. What is the text to image ratio?
5. Do you host images internally or externally? Is the external provider reliable?
6. What is the size of your images? Did you optimize file size and doubled images for retina screens?
7. Do you have well defined roles in the email marketing team? How large is the team and what’s the overall commitment (campaign owner, email sender, designer, coder, data miner, copywriter)?
8. Is it Commercial or Transactional campaign?
9. What’s the source of data for subscribers? Is it reliable in terms of a status, bounces, and privacy?


## Content Creation Best Practices



*   Write a compelling subject line
*   Consider the rest of your envelope’s content - sender, a snippet of the email’s content
*   Design your email for all devices
*   Select visually interesting and resonating photos and graphics
*   Choose a meaningful color palette, branding-wise
*   Communicate in a clear brand voice
*   Make call-to-actions (CTA) stand out
*   Consider consumer behaviour (whether in the office or on the go, wearables, send-time-optimization…)
*   Test for multiple email clients and devices
*   Review and optimize plain text version (wearable devices)
