The unintended consequence is that non essentialists managers try to have their team pursuit too many things and try to do too many things themselves as well and the teams plateau at its progress.

*   What problem are you solving?
*   What opportunity are you creating?
*   Why would you want to spend time working on something that isnâ€™t going to bring about a positive change?
