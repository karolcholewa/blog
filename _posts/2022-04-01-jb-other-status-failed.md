In Journey Builder, the **Failed** status doesn't mean the Contact failed when analyzing the journey history. Today is the **April Foolsâ€™ Day** but no pun intended&hellip;

## Failed to Proceed
Journey History displays the following status: *"Failed - MetExitCriteria/MetGoalCriteria"*. It means that the Contact within the journey, met the criteria and failed to move to next activity.
The status **Failed** in the UI, indicates exiting a journey after meeting **Goal** or **Exit Criteria**.
