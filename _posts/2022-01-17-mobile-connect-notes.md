This is a work in progress post that collects practical notes from working with the Mobile Studio.

## Mobile Push Notes
*   A client's mobile app integrates with SFMC using MobileSDK
*   Device ID pairs with Contact Key after a successful log in to the app process
*   Deleting a Contact from SFMC removes the Device ID pairing, until a new Contact is created and a successful log in to the app is repeated

## Mobile Connect Notes
*   FromName can be provisioned or customized but this feature is not supported in all locales. For example South Africa does not support FromName
*   Short codes are specific to a country, but you can use long codes to reach multiple countries for example Austria and Italy could use the same long code
