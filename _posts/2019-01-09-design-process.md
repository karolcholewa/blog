Good design arises from the initial problem, goals, audience, or leadership needs, business plans. It reflects the identity and brand of the client.

    *   Who's your target?
    *   What makes you better than your competition?
    *   Is there any impeding or current legislation that will affect your business?
    *   Communicate a single thing about this product
*   Task-based usability
