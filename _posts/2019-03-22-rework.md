I started this post to summarize another book from the Basecamp but I don’t really remember it&hellip;It was a bit slight read with an obvious, general message. It has this ‘rebel’ particle. It praises the vision for the “Show me” approach as opposed to “Let’s call a meeting to discuss it”. Here are some really good notes that I found on the internet (Payton Stafford comments on Goodreads):

>   Ignore this book at your own peril. Seth Godin


*   Everything is marketing.
*   Say no to default
*   Don’t copy competitors-create something new
*   Make tiny decisions
*   Make attainable goals
*   Use tiny decisions to work through even large projects
*   Use the power of no to get your priorities straight.
*   Be true to a type of customer rather than to specific customers.
*   Build an audience by teaching customers rather than paying for advertising.
*   Don't confuse enthusiasm with priorities.
*   Prioritize visually, with next task at top of list
*   Make short lists to avoid feeling overwhelmed
*   Hold meetings at site of problem, not in meeting room. Invite as few as possible.
*   Divide problems and projects into pieces small enough to easily estimate time and effort required.
*   Be open about your processes, flaws and opinions. This will create more credibility than trying to appear perfect.
*   Don't hire someone until you've tried to do the work yourself.
*   Hire only as a last resort.
*   Ignore resumes. Check cover letter. Look for 6 months+ experience, but after that the learning curve flattens.
*   Hire managers of 1 -- self-directed people who can set their own goals and reach them without help.
*   Get back to people quickly. Value their time. Expect them to object to change.
*   Good work environments result from trust, autonomy, privacy. Don't require approval. Send people home at five.
*   Don't create policies because one person did something wrong once.
