This is one of those posts I revised in 2021 for an obvious reason. The Basecamp company (the authors of this book are:	Fried Jason, Heinemeier Hansson David, Hansson David Heinemeier) is a visionary organization in many ways. Perhaps it is only a luck (or a black swan) but the catchword *office not required* became reality during the Sars-Covid19 pandemic. 

Here are some quotes from this book.

> No assholy behaviour allowed. No drama allowed. No bad vibes allowed.

> It’s never a good idea to let poisonous people stick around to spoil it for everyone else. But in a remote work setup - it’s DEADLY.

> Don’t be a cultural or a geographical hermit.

> The new luxury is the luxury of freedom and time.
