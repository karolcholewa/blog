title: "Birthday Card Email Campaign"
categories: HTML
---

Marketing Cloud used to have **Playbooks** to create common campaigns such as on-boarding, anniversary, or birthday emails. I never used Playbooks which eventually have been retired and replaced by Journey Builder templates.

To create a simple Birthday campaign I used **Automation Studio** as follows:

1. Create a Birthday Segment and a SQL Query Activity to import data daily
2. Create a Birthday Email and a Send Email Activity to send an email daily
3. Create an Automation and schedule it to run daily


## SQL Query Activity

A date of birth needs to be imported as an attribute in All Subscribers or a column in Data Extension. You can compare the day and the month from the birthday date to todayâ€™s date values. Assuming that both are represented by the same data type (Date) it is relatively easy. Make sure this Date Extension **Is Sendable** - you will send the Birthday emails to this list.

I covered a scenario with some data conversions [in this post.](https://youdontneedwp.com/emailgeek/sql-birthday-segment)


## Send Email Activity

Create a nice, personalized Birthday email, test, and use it for for the Send Email Activity. 


## Automation

Create a scheduled automation to run daily in the morning (for example at 7 am). In the first step you run SQL query to overwrite data in the Birthday segment and in step two send the Birthday email.
