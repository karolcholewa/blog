These are notes from a Salesforce webinar - *SFMC Lookup Answers* - dedicated to Server Side JavaScript. SSJS is an old version of JS and it works **synchronously**. API calls have **asynchronous** options.

## Performance
*   don’t mix AMPScript with SSJS
*   don’t use Core for email
*   use as simple as possible SSJS - avoid complex solutions
*   While dealing with data - use SQL combined with SSJS

## Beginner and Intermediate Use Cases
*   web pages
*   script activities (WSProxy)
*   HTML forms
*   Parsing JSON object

## When to use SSJS and AMPScript
*   API calls
*   SSJS uses arrays, JSON
*   CRM interactions
*   Anything related to email - AMPScript
*   Complex code - try SSJS
*   Loops: while, do while, for, for in
*   Try-Catch

## Favorite Functions
*   Content Syndication
*   Script.Util.HttpRequest
*   Get/Post Data
*   ParseJSON
