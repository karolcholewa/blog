Scrum is a framework for agile project management that helps teams collaborate, prioritize, and deliver value to customers. Scrum can also help you reduce anxiety by breaking down complex tasks into manageable chunks, giving you clear feedback, and empowering you to make decisions&hellip;

Using Scrum can help you manage your anxiety by giving you structure, clarity, and support. Here are some tips on how to use Scrum to alleviate anxiety at work:

- Start your day with a **stand-up meeting**. This is a short, daily meeting where you and your team share what you did yesterday, what you plan to do today, and any challenges or blockers you face. This helps you stay aligned, accountable, and motivated toward the **sprint goal**.
- Use a **sprint backlog**. This is a list of tasks that you and your team commit to complete in a fixed period of time, usually one or two weeks. This helps you focus on the most important and urgent work, and avoid distractions and scope creep.
- Track your progress with a **sprint board**. This is a visual tool that shows the status of your tasks: to do, in progress, done, or blocked. This helps you see your achievements, identify problems, and celebrate wins.
- Review your work with a **sprint review**. This is a meeting where you and your team demonstrate what you have done to your stakeholders and get feedback. This helps you validate your assumptions, learn from your mistakes, and improve your quality.
- Reflect on your process with a **sprint retrospective**. This is a meeting where you and your team discuss what went well, what didn't go well, and what you can do better next time. This helps you grow as a team, address issues, and foster a culture of continuous improvement.
