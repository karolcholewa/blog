It's all about proper, branded content that's built, tested and delivered just on time. With small, incidental email campaigns it does not sound very difficult. Neither should it for fast-growing organizations who rely on high quality content&hellip;

## Prototype, Build and Test in Content Builder
Email Studio is a perfect environment for building emails using reusable content blocks. I am in favor of a single template file and a collection of reusable, drag-and-drop, (shared) content blocks. A few key findings from working with EDS based on content blocks in CB:
*   Set Roles and Permission and prevent from deleting important resources
*   Know the email development limitations and pitfalls; this reduces the amount of questions and speeds up training
*   Know your branding; this helps maintain high standards
*   Know your design elements collection; this helps you rapidly prototype an email directly in Content Builder
*   Master your collection; this helps you easily adjust the content blocks to any product-specific or rebranded/new brand design
*   Email layouts do not change; 1-, 2-, 3-columns
*   Train the team regularly in order to keep up with high standards
*   Experts can't get complacent and stay up-to-date
*   Content is always late
*   A nice and clean EDS in CB can get messy very fast
*   SFMC is not always perfect - test before sending
