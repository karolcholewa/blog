A simple use case for using measures.

## Use Case
A Marketing team promoted a paid webinar, sold tickets and wanted to distribute an email campaign with a unique login code to each participant. As the code is mandatory to get in, the expected open rate for the campaign is 100%. The team prepared other communication channels to follow up in case the email was not opened (for example would send a code over Whatsapp or call the participant).

## Using Measure
After the email had been sent to a sendable data extension, I created a **Measure** definition to select records who did not open the email (JobID). Then, I created a filtered data extension to segment subscribers and resend the email with the code. The source for the filtered data extension was the initial sendable data extension with the codes. As a filter I picked the Measure equal to 1. The resulting filtered DE contains subscribers who did not open the email.
