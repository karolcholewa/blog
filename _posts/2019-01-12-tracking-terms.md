This is a part of the official Trailhead online training: [Email Creation and Sending.](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/email-creation-and-sending)
I've used its content to list useful terms related to tracking and to refer to them as a useful glossary.

*   **Sent**- Total number of emails sent.
*  **Delivered**- Total number of emails delivered.
*  **Deliverability Rate** - The percentage of emails that were delivered compared to the number that bounced (soft and hard).
*  **Total Soft Bounces** - The number of emails that were recognized by recipientsâ€™ mail servers but were returned to the sender because their mailboxes were full or the mail servers were temporarily unavailable.
*  **Total Hard Bounces** - Number of emails that permanently bounced back to the sender because the addresses were invalid.
*  **Email Opens**- The total number of times subscribers open an email where the images render.
*  **Open Rate**- The percentage of emails that were opened (images rendered) compared to the number that were delivered.
*  **Clicks**- The number of subscribers who clicked on a link in the email.
