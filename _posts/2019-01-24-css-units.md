title: "CSS Relative Units"
categories: HTML
---


CSS has several different units for expressing a length. The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these: cm, mm, in; will appear as exactly that size. **Pixels (px)** are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.

Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.
