Configure **Send Throttling** when setting up email send and use it for these reasons:
*   To control inbound traffic to a website or a support center, meaning, the interest generated by email may result in server crashes or resources overload due to too many people visiting.
*   To limit the number of emails sent to a particular domain each hour.

## Example

A car manufacturing marketing team is about to send an email regarding the recall of a specific model car as a result of a faulty airbag. The team will use Send Throttling to send the emails slowly throughout the day and avoid the volume of support calls to spike.
