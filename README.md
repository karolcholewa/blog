## About
This is a repository for a personal weblog https://www.karolcholewa.pl. The posts on this blog are my notes written in a plain, simplified English similar to the language found in technical documentation. I document anything thatâ€™s useful at work that is: **HTML email hacks, MSExcel formulas, SQL queries, JavaScript** snippets plus some loose ideas or tips about the web and career.
