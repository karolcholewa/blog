Disciple of experience. Matchlessly weird, well proportional and gentle, left handed, vege, gay. Curious, passionate, and always sould of wonder. He got bored and distracted too easily especially when the project turned routine rather than creative. Apart from the “Abacus School”, Leonardo was mainly self-taught. Leonardo left 7200 page of notes - greatest records of curiosity. 
The post is short and sweet which is a complete oposite da Vinci's biography. Isaackson paid a tribute to the genius of all times so my note is only to keep a track of my bookshelf.
