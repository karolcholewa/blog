This is a post with sample interview questions for Salesforce Marketing Cloud. These are rather closed, generic questions (no scenarios or tasks) which help evaluate knowledge about logical statements, relational database, or specific/proprietary SFMC terms. 

## Questions
1. What is the difference between Primary Key Contact ID, Contact Key, Subscriber Key and Subscriber ID?
2. How to get rid of duplicate records? (SQL query)
3. Where to use AMPScript?
4. What's the difference between AMPScript and SSJS?
