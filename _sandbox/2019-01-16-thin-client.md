In some ways technology comes full circle from a fat client to a thin client infrastructure. You no longer “telnet” to a server but rather use SaaS and cloud services even from your smartphone.


I am not a fan of carrying a laptop with me from home to the office back and forth. I have setup a powerful desktop PC in the office and for home I use my laptop as a sort of **thin client**. I can literally split processing power between my PC to do some rendering work or access apps not installed on my laptop while keeping my laptop to its bare minimum for web apps only.


Using your smartphone to work remotely for eight hours is not a solution but the old, Windows friend - the Remote Desktop (RDP) does the job well.
